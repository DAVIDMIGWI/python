# we do data type
# 1. numbers ints. floats, complex
# 2. strings
# 3. lists
# 4. tuples
# dictionatries
# sets
# we store above database in variables
# variables store data. think of variables as containers
age =20 #int no decimal

# Rules for variable names.
# 1. You cannot start with a number but you can have the number at the end
# 2. No spacing, use underscore i.e my_name
# 3. use capital letters. names are case sensitive. i.e MAX , Max- they are diferent
# 4. use capital letters for constant i.e PI = 3.14
